    - assets/images/cap3.jpg

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a

  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Inconsolata
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inconsolata-ExtraLight.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inconsolata-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inconsolata-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inconsolata-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inconsolata-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 700

  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
